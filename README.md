# linuxupdate
This is a script to upgrade your LINUX system. It makes life a little easier :)

Note: I understand that the quality of this script is low and I should probably make it with bash (will soon), but it was hacked together for a reason. It was quick and easy to make. If you care that much, please move on. I will update it soon, chill. Understand, this was for personal use, I know it is bad, it's not supposed to be good, it's supposed to work.

## The old script uses "apt-get" instead of just "apt". I'd reccomend you use the current script (the one that uses just "apt").

The script requires Python and apt (they come with linux by default). 
### Features:
Automatically and quickly update/upgrade your system.

You can provide custom arguments for the apt commands such as "-y" so the command runs as "apt upgrade -y".

The script will ask you if you want to upgrade your distributions as well.

The script updates and upgrades once redundently (runs both upgrade and update twice).

### Note:
This script was originally made for my personal use, it's not perfect. I tried to make it prettier for sharing but again, it was originally made for personal use. I decided to share the script if someone else thought it would be helpful. Feel free to submit an issue if you find one, but don't expect it to be fixed anytime soon :)
