# linuxupdate
## A script to upgrade your system. This makes life a little easier.
The script requires Python and apt (they come with linux by default).

### Features:
Automatically and quickly update/upgrade your system.

You can provide custom arguments for the apt commands such as "-y" so the command runs as "apt upgrade -y".

The script will ask you if you want to upgrade your distributions as well.

The script updates and upgrades once redundently (runs both upgrade and update twice).
