# linuxupdate
This is a script to upgrade your LINUX system. It makes life a little easier :)

## This script uses apt instead of apt-get. If that is a problem, just edit the script ;)

The script requires apt. You should have that :)
### Features:
Make updating your Linux system quicker!

You can provide custom arguments for the apt commands such as "-y" so the command runs as "apt upgrade -y". You can enter nothing (just press enter) for no arguments.

The script will ask you if you want to upgrade your distributions as well.

The script updates and upgrades once redundently (runs both upgrade and update twice). Sorry if this annoys you.

### Note:
This script was originally made for my personal use, it's not perfect. I tried to make it prettier for sharing but again, it was originally made for personal use. I decided to share the script if someone else thought it would be helpful. Feel free to submit an issue if you find one, but don't expect it to be fixed anytime soon :)

# ISSUES:
If you enter an invalid argument, you will receive the following error: "The update command takes no arguments".
